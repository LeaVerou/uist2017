      <p>When you register yourself, you can also register children and/or a care giver (for yourself or for the child).
      	<ul>
			<li><b>Children</b> (USD 10) &mdash; registered children are welcome to attend any UIST event, including the Demo Reception and the Conference Banquet.  No drink tickets will be included with child registration.  You do not have to register your child, of course, but if you want to bring them to any of the events, they have to be formally registered so that they are covered by the ACM insurance.
			</li>
			<li><b>Care Givers</b> (USD 50) &mdash; this registration category is for people providing care to the conference attendees with impairments or to the chidren of conference attendees.  It grants the person access to all events (including the Demo Reception) <b>except the Tuesday night Banquet.</b>  No drink tickets will be included with the care giver registration.  If you would like your care giver to attend the Banquet, you will be able to purchase an additional Banquet ticket when you register your care giver.  
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Additional Demo Reception and Banquet Tickets</h3>
	<p>If you would like to bring additional people (friends, colleagues, etc.) to the Demo Reception on Monday night (held at the hotel) or to the Conference Banquet (held at the <a href="https://www.mnbaq.org/en">Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec</a>), you can purchase additional tickets during the registration process.
