<h1>Sponsoring UIST</h1>

<p id="toc" class="compact"></p>

<p>You are invited to support the UIST 2017 conference. This is an ideal way to demonstrate your organization's interest in and commitment to the field of user interface software and technology, and to publicize this support to many leaders and students in the field.
Corporate support is typically used to permit a greater number of students to attend UIST at reduced fees without artificially increasing the general registration, and to allow student volunteers to receive complimentary registration. Corporate support can also be targeted to a particular event or activity at the UIST Conference.</p>

<p>The UIST 2017 conference has four corporate support levels:
		<a href="sponsor/#platinum">Platinum</a>,
		<a href="sponsor/#gold">Gold</a>,
		<a href="sponsor/#silver">Silver</a>,
		<a href="sponsor/#bronze">Bronze</a>, and
		<a href="sponsor/#friends">Friends</a>.
		Your support is very important to the conference, and the conference committee ensures that these contributions are well recognized. We list the benefits and costs below. (If you can think of another benefit that would make this more attractive to your company, do let us know!)

<p><strong>Interested in supporting UIST 2017? Contact our sponsorship chair at <a href="mailto:sponsorship@uist.org">sponsorship@uist.org</a></strong></p>
