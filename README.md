Website for ACM UIST 2017

## Editing

Before making any CSS edits:

- First, install Node and npm if you don't already have it
- `cd` to the website folder and run `npm install`

After that, run `gulp watch` before you make any edits, and it will automatically generate any files needed.

For now, `gulp` is only used to preprocess CSS.
Once the website has multiple pages, it will also be used for templating, so the process above will be needed for editing HTML too.
