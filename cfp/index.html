	<p>Papers are the main medium for conveying new research results at UIST.
		Submissions are sought that describe original, unpublished work on user interface interaction techniques, systems, tools, services, devices or applications.
		Please consult the <a href="author-guide">UIST 2017 Author's Guide</a> for information on submission format and policies for previous and simultaneous publications.
		Note that paper submissions must be anonymous! Authors must remove their names and affiliations from the masthead and refer to their own previous work in third person when possible.
		See the <a href="author-guide/#anonymous-submission-process">anonymization policy in the Author’s Guide</a> for more information.

	<section>
		<h1>Paper Length and Presentation Time</h1>
		<p>Papers can be of any page length, though should be commensurate with the size of the contribution.
			A new idea presented in a compact format is more likely to be accepted than the same idea in a long format.
			Exceptionally long papers (over 10 pages) need to include very strong contributions to warrant acceptance.
			Shorter, focused papers (called "notes" in years prior to 2011) are still an appropriate submission length for UIST and encouraged.
			<strong>References do not count towards the page length.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>In rare cases, authors may be requested to shorten papers in a camera-ready, for example by removing sections that detracts from a paper’s main contribution. Papers that are 6 or fewer pages will have shorter presentation times than longer papers at the conference. However, there will be no distinction made between papers based on length in the program, proceedings or digital library. Exact talk durations will be determined when the program is finalized.
</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Submission Requirements</h1>
		<p>When you submit your work, you will be asked to agree to the terms and conditions of the <a href="https://chi2017.acm.org/wp/sigchi-submitter-agreement/" target="_blank">SIGCHI Submitter Agreement</a>.
			In addition, the author list must be complete by the submission deadline.
			Late author changes require approval from Program Chairs and may be declined or require paper withdrawal because of reviewing conflicts.
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Videos</h1>
		<p>The submission of a supplementary Video Figure is strongly encouraged, especially in cases of interactive techniques or systems, where videos play an important role in convincing reviewers that the contribution works as described. Video Figures should be no more than six minutes long and the total size of a submission (including the paper) is limited to 100 MB.
			See the <a href="video-guide" target="_blank">video guide</a> for details.
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Reviewing and Rebuttal Process</h1>
		<p>Rigorous reviewing is a hallmark of UIST. Each paper will be reviewed by 3 external reviewers (experts in the area who are not on the Program Committee). Additionally, every paper will receive a review from a member of the Program Committee. On May 22, 2017, authors will be notified of their initial reviews. If reviews fall below a rebuttal threshold, the paper will be rejected at this stage; otherwise, the authors will have the opportunity to submit a rebuttal. One additional review from the Program Committee will be entered post-rebuttal for papers requiring additional discussion. On July 26, 2017, authors will be notified if their papers have been conditionally accepted or rejected.
</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Conditional Acceptance</h1>
		<p>All acceptances will be conditional pending changes that the Program Committee may suggest or require for the final camera-ready paper. This means that a paper will not be accepted to UIST until authors revise and submit the final camera-ready paper for approval by the Program Committee. The length of the camera-ready paper must be less than or equal to the length of the original submission unless there is a strong justification for increasing the paper length, which would require approval by the authors’ primary reviewer.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Video Previews</h1>
		<p>UIST will not be accepting 30-second Video Previews this year. Instead, we encourage authors to submit full length videos to accompany their submissions. See Videos section above for more details.
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Format</h1>
		<p>All paper submissions must be made in the <strong>2016</strong> version of the <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform" target="_blank">SIGCHI papers format</a>
			(Note that this format utilizes the newer “Firstname M. Lastname” convention.). Note that references do not count towards the paper length.
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Public Dissemination Date</h1>
		<p>The title and abstract of all accepted papers are typically announced shortly after the final camera-ready paper deadline (around August 2017). Note, however, that this is not the official publication date.
			The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to one month prior to the first day of the conference. Therefore, the official publication date, also known as the official public dissemination date, may be as early as September 2017.

	<p>Posters provide an interactive forum in which authors can present their work to conference attendees during special poster sessions. Posters are an opportunity to describe new work or work that is still in progress, and will be more lightly reviewed than papers. The posters track welcomes innovative research, as well as innovative ways of doing research.
	<p>All poster submissions must include a two-page "abstract" and a full size poster design. Note that poster submissions, unlike paper submissions, are not anonymous. The abstract describes the research problem, contribution, and value to UIST attendees. The abstract must be formatted using the SIGCHI Papers Format (use the <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform/sigchi-papers-word-template/view" target="_blank">Word Template</a> or <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform/sigchi-papers-latex-template/view" target="_blank">Latex Template</a>) and submitted as a PDF. The poster design must be less than 30 x 40 inches (76 × 101 cm), either portrait or landscape orientation, and submitted as a PDF. The <a href="https://uist.acm.org/uist2005/posterexamplegallery.html" target="_blank">UIST 2005 Poster Example Gallery</a> has ideas and guidelines for poster designs.  Authors are also encouraged to submit an optional video no more than three minutes long, see the <a href="video-guide" target="_blank">video guide</a> for acceptable formats.
	<p>The poster abstract, poster design, and optional video must be submitted electronically to <a href="http://precisionconference.com/~sigchi" target="_blank">Precision Conference</a> before the submission date below. The total size for all files must be less than 50 MB. See the <a href="video-guide" target="_blank">video guide</a>, the <a href="author-guide" target="_blank">author guide</a>, and <a href="author-guide/#advice" target="_blank">general submission information</a> for more details about preparing your submission.

	<section>
		<h1>Selection process</h1>
		<p>The selection process for UIST posters is <a href="https://chi2017.acm.org/wp/selection-processes/" target="_blank">juried</a>. As stated in the CHI selection process: “Juried content is reviewed by a committee but in a less rigorous process than refereed and does not include an author’s response or conditional acceptance. Juried content is generally not required to make the same level of lasting and significant contribution to our knowledge and understanding as refereed content. Authors who submit to juried tracks may expect to receive light feedback of up to a few paragraphs in length.“
		<p>Incomplete or incorrect submission content or formats will be desk rejected. Late submissions are not permitted, and the deadline below is final. Do not submit the same work to both the demo and poster tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as a demo submission and will be automatically rejected from the poster track.
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Posters are non-archival</h1>
		<p>UIST posters are non-archival and UIST allows resubmission of posters previously shown at other venues. Authors should state previous poster venues in the appropriate box in the upload form and point out differences to previous posters.
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>At the conference</h1>
		<p>All accepted posters will be displayed during a portion of the conference. At least one author is requested to stand by their poster during poster sessions to speak with conference attendees.
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>After the conference</h1>
		<p>Accepted poster abstracts will be published as adjunct proceedings in the ACM Digital Library and distributed in digital form to conference attendees. Authors can make accepted poster designs and videos available at their discretion.

	<p>Demonstrations show early implementations of novel and compelling interaction concepts, techniques, devices and systems. They can also serve to showcase commercial products not previously described in the research literature. Demonstrations should be brief, so that they can be shown repeatedly. We particularly encourage demos with which attendees can interact.
	<p>Accepted demonstration abstracts will be published together with posters and doctoral symposium abstracts and made available digitally to conference attendees. UIST will showcase accepted demos at an evening reception. We will also invite authors of accepted papers to present their work at the demo reception.
	<p>A demo submission should follow the official SIGCHI conference publication paper format (<a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform/sigchi-papers-word-template/view" target="_blank">Word Template</a> or <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform/sigchi-papers-latex-template/view" target="_blank">Latex Template</a>), and should be no more than two pages in length, not including references. Note that demo submissions, unlike paper submissions, are not anonymous.
	<p>All papers should be submitted electronically to: <a href="http://www.precisionconference.com/~sigchi" target="_blank">http://www.precisionconference.com/~sigchi</a>.

	<section>
		<h1>Selection process</h1>
		<p>The selection process for UIST demos is curated, that is, selected by an esteemed committee, but not sent out to external reviewers. The curated demo content will be selected from demonstration submissions, accepted papers, as well as projects invited by the demo chairs. Authors will not receive formal feedback on their submission other than the selection decision.
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Note</h1>
		<p>The demo submission should include a (mock-up) photo of the demonstration showing the envisioned setup (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights and other equipment), as well as the demonstrators alongside conference attendees interacting with the demo. Please label and annotate all parts of the image(s) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup. This will also allow the organizers to better consider your requirements when organizing the demonstration space at the conference. Submitting an accompanying video is optional, but highly encouraged.
			Any submitted video should be no longer than <strong>three minutes</strong> and at most <strong>50MB</strong> in size.</p>

	<p>The UIST Doctoral Symposium is a forum in which Ph.D. students can meet and discuss their work with each other and a panel of experienced UIST researchers in an informal and interactive setting. We welcome applications from current Ph.D. students studying within the full range of disciplines and approaches that contribute to the UIST community. We will give preference to applicants beyond the proposal stage and well into their dissertation research.</p>
	<p>Each applicant should provide a short written paper (no more than four pages (<strong>including references</strong>) in the official SIGCHI conference publication format (<a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform/sigchi-papers-word-template/view" target="_blank">Word Template</a>
	or <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform/sigchi-papers-latex-template/view" target="_blank">Latex Template</a>), as described in
	<a href="author-guide" target="_blank">the author's guide</a>).
	Note that doctoral symposium submission, unlike paper submission, is not anonymous; doctoral symposium submissions should be single-authored, where the student applying is the sole author. This paper should describe ongoing work and might summarize your full dissertation work, or highlight a particular part in depth.
	<p>The Doctoral Symposium committee will select approximately eight students to participate. Participants will be selected based on their anticipated contributions to the breadth and depth of the intellectual discussions of the symposium.
	<p>Each student will be expected to give a short presentation of their work, which will be followed by extensive discussion with the panel and the other student participants. The symposium will be held at the UIST 2017 venue from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. on Sunday, October 22nd, 2017 (and will begin with a welcome dinner the evening of Saturday, October 21st, at 6:30 pm). In addition, each student is encouraged to present a poster describing his or her work to the full conference; posters will be on display for two days during the conference.
	<p>Doctoral Symposium abstracts will be published together with poster and demonstration abstracts and made available digitally to conference attendees (though they are considered a “non-archival” publication). Posters may also be published at the participant's discretion.</p>
	<p>Accepted students will receive complimentary registration to the UIST 2017 conference, and a complimentary hotel room at the conference venue (on a shared basis; same-gendered members of the symposium will be paired together for room sharing). Travel subsidies will also be available to participants (the exact value of the travel subsidies has not yet been determined).</p>
	<p>Doctoral Symposium papers and poster sketches should be submitted electronically to the Precision Conference System. Additional Doctoral Symposium Panelists to be announced soon.</p>

		<h1>Benefits and Duties</h1>
		<p>If you are a UIST Student Volunteer, you get:

		<ul>
			<li>Free conference registration</li>
			<li>Free T-shirt</li>
			<li>A great SV party with free dinner</li>
			<li>A chance to attend the premier forum for innovations in human-computer
			interfaces</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Student volunteers will be required to help set up and perform needed work
		during the conference. Duties include: bag stuffing, registration desk, AV
		assistance, poster and demo setup, badge checking, break monitoring, etc.
		Volunteers will also need to be available during the conference if tasks
		come up. SVs usually get to attend most of the sessions, even when working.
		There will be approximately 14 scheduled hours per SV.

		<h2>Arriving and Leaving</h2>
		<p>SVs need to be available to help throughout the conference. You will
		need to arrive on or before Saturday afternoon (Oct. 15) for the SV
		orientation and should not leave the conference venue until sessions end on
		Wednesday (Oct. 19). Also, we strongly encourage you to put off leaving
		until as late as you possibly can, because it's traditional to have a small
		party for student volunteers on Wednesday evening. The time and place for
		this party will be announced when we know all the student volunteers' travel
		plans.

		<h2>Work Schedules</h2>
		<p>To give you an idea of what to expect, you can see the <a href="http://www.acm.org/uist/uist2008/uist06schedule.html">UIST 2006 Student Volunteer Schedule</a>.

		<h2>Accommodation</h2>
		<p>We will not be able to provide free accommodation, but we will help you
		team up with other student volunteers for sharing rooms and we will provide
		a list of hotels with affordable room rates.
